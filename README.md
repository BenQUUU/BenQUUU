## Hi I'm MichaÅ‚ ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my GitHub profile!  I have been passionate about computer science since childhood. As a novice software developer, I'm eager to expand my knowledge and skills in these fields. Over the last few years, I've been dedicated to learning modern C++ programming, along with popular tools useful for working with this language.

I'm currently trying to obtain an engineering degree in this field. These studies have not only systematized my knowledge, but also provided me with a deeper understanding of good programming practices, knowledge of electronics or databases. Earlier, after becoming a teleinformatics technician at a general secondary education, I learned a lot about how computer and telecommunications networks work.

## Technologies I'm Familiar With
* C/C++
* Python
* STL
* GDB
* CMake, qmake
* Valgrind
* Qt
* Git
* SQL

Thank you for visiting my profile, and I look forward to connecting with you!
